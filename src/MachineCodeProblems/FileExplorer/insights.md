1. Its similar to the nested checkbox or nested comments
2. The new thing here is to add and remove new items
3. Follow the same logic. Recursively find the matched node from the state list
4. Make changes to that node and updated the list
5. Update the state

6. If u want to provide the expand and collapse of the chidren items, then add a new property to each item as isExpanded, based on that expand or collapse the children
or conditionally render the children
