# INSIGHTS :

1. More of a CSS problem
2. Need to work with transition to smooth out the progress bar
3. Should handle the case when time runs out and 100% is already achieved
4. The delay that u give in transition, pay attention to that
    - If its a lot, then the progress number will be 100 but the shown value will be delayed by that much time


# Requirements :

1. Show a progress bar with animation to show the progress
2. Color should be configurable


# Advanced :

1. Show the progress % value just above/ below the progress bar
2. Allow to add a progress bar on click of a button
3. Allow say only 3 progress bars to work at a time. Once any is done, then the next in queue will be added to the progress show
4. Clickable progress bar ?
